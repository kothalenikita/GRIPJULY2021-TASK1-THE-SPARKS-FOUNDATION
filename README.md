TASK 1 - Prediction using Supervised ML (Level - Beginner) Predicting the percentage of a student based on the no. of study hours per day. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables. Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data. I used Pyhton tool to complete this task. TASK OBJECTIVE: What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

TASK 2 : Prediction using Unsupervised ML (Level - Beginner) 'IRIS Dataset'. I used Python to perform this task. Data can be found at https://bit.ly/3cGyP8j TASK OBJECTIVE: To predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

TASK 3 : To Explore Business Analytics (Level - Beginner) Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on the provided dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’. TASK OBJECTIVE: As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit. Derive Business Problems from exploring data. Dataset link :https://bit.ly/3i4rbWl.

TASK 4 : Exploratory Data Analysis - Sports (Level - Advanced) Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Indian Premier League’ TASK OBJECTIVE: As a sports analysts, find out the most successful teams, players and factors contributing win or loss of a team. Suggest teams or players a company should endorse for its products. Dataset: https://bit.ly/34SRn3b.

TASK 5 : Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm (Level - Intermediate) Objective : Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. Problem Statement : The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly. Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox.
